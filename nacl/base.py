Basic functions for the nacl package

This module should contain some basic functions, needed
within the nacl package.
Curerntly it does not. This is a design flaw we need to
correct.

There should be moved here:
    * get_users_nacl_conf() from nacl.fileutils

Maybe other functions will fit here in as well.
